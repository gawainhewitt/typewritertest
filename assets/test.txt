In 2015 and 2016 I embarked on a series of field recordings, instrument design and concerts with the intention to shock me out of a split artistic state. I was leading spontaneous music making, community music, accessible musical instrument design and sound art. All elements felt separate and like they existed on their own, looking at each other across the valleys from their respective peaks. In the background the musician in me felt neglected. I had played since early childhood, through experiments with computers, rockbands, choirs and later recording studios. But now, the musician part of me felt threatened and unloved, perhaps even homeless - I had lost the path in my early twenties. Losing touch with the joy of sound making, I began to think of success as a destination until it was all I was making music for. When my technical learning reached a place of confidence and “good enough” I realised that I had no idea why I was making music any more. So I decided to stop. I sold my musical instruments and equipment and tried to concentrate on other things, telling myself to grow up and be an adult, to get a proper job. 
Yet, like water, it dripped back in. At first imperceptibly, I found myself sound making, exploring, playing. I discovered sound art and had ideas for pieces. Making use of my existing music networks I pitched ideas and found a flow that had never existed in my music before. People wanted me, my output was prolific. I re-engaged with community music, working with disabled musicians to make accessible instruments, and leading workshops in schools and community settings, often with marginalised groups. A long series of creative work in Pupil Referral Units with jazz promoters Serious introduced me to, among others, Arun Ghosh, Chris Sharkey, Dave Kane and Corey Mwamba. Co-leading with each, one at a time, we developed a new way of leading creative workshops based on free improvisation, exploration and non verbal musical scaffolding. 
This became my safe place to make an artistic living, yet the musician in me was still frustrated and insecure. I planned to immerse myself in a bigger version of what I was asking others to do in my workshops, aiming to bring it all back together and regain a sense of wholeness and creativity in my music making. How can I as a maker of instruments, art and sound “be” as a musician? 
The project consisted of a summer field trip to the tundra and mountains of Norway and a series of concerts and artistic collaborations across the UK and Norway. The recording Beneath the Waves is of an improvisation I did with Corey Mwamba in Derby during August 2016. I am playing a modular synth, a hydrophone, an Akai MPC sampler and several manipulated recordings including those made in water in Norway, and a vocal recording written and recorded for me by songwriter Abimaro. 
This concert is a record of the point when it all started to work. I felt in touch with being a musician again in my own image. Crucially, the point at which, through free improvisation, I had discovered a way of making music that felt easy and natural to me.
